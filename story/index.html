				<p>To: Niken</p>

				<p>
					I still don't know how to express it until now. Word by word, tone by
					tone or even code by code. after a few years of only seeing you on
					homepage and facebook stories.
				</p>
				<p>
					I remember one day you sent my birthday wishes on my profile. it's
					something I never had. You, Niken, posted something on mine.
				</p>
				<p>
					I thought well that's a nice and casual thing done by you to other
					people too. But to me, it's an amazing thing.
				</p>
				<p>
					You're pretty, cute, smart and your beauty voice. It's all on you. And
					you deserve the best for it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I know. hope it hurts. But it hurts even more if it's never delivered.
					And it's a wound worth trying. For the last.
